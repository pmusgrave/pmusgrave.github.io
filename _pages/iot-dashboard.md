As the number of Internet-connected and Raspberry Pi projects I've completed has grown over time, I've been trying to come up with a solution to manage these projects more easily than SSH-ing in to the RPi and doing everything manually. To that end, I created a React web app and REST API to control settings, and query and display data generated by those projects in an easier, more streamlined way.

At the present moment, the web app has components for three of these IoT projects: an [RGB LED driver](/led-driver) I completed a while ago, a data visualization component to display data captured by a temperature and humidity sensor, and a page that lists running times and distances logged by my [run-logger wearable project](/runlogger).

Turning on lights and displaying temperature data might not seem like the most interesting use cases of an IoT system, but I like to think of this almost like an "IoT hello world" system. I've built the components at every level one would need in an IoT application. Down to flipping a bit on a microcontroller, reading data from a sensor, serial communication, a database server, an MQTT broker, web server, REST API, and a React frontend dashboard. All of these modules can be extended orthogonally in the future to create a full fledged Internet connected smart home system that controls or logs data for anything I might be interested in.
