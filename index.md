Hi, I'm Paul. I like solving problems and building things.

I've specialized in audio electronics for the past few years, but I also like working on microcontroller firmware and systems software in C, web apps in Javascript and React, and more recently desktop applications in C# using the .NET Windows Presentation Foundation framework.

For a description of personal project I've worked on, see the [Projects](/projects) page. Most of the code for these projects is available on my [Github](https://github.com/pmusgrave).
