Hi, I'm Paul. I like solving problems and building things. My latest project is an IoT home automation system and dashboard in React that ties together a lot of microcontroller projects I built. I've previously designed high quality pro audio equipment and developed software in the structural engineering industry. 

For a description of personal projects I've worked on, see the [Projects](/projects) page. Most of the code for these projects is available on my [Github](https://github.com/pmusgrave).
