I was looking for a good learning project two achieve two goals. First, I've been learning the Rust programming language and I was looking for a project to solidify what I learned from the Rust Book. Second, I was interested in learning how to write full-screen console programs using the Ncurses library for Unix systems. This project knocked out both goals in one go, with the help of ncurses-rs, a rust wrapper for ncurses.
