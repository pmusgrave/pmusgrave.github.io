Ever since I first started programming, I've had this vision of my own personal library of code, exemplifying the best possible code reuse. I think the ideal case is a collection of things I've built on my own, that are as easy to plug together as external libraries. This is nowhere near that ideal, and I've only started working on it recently, but it's something I keep coming back to and adding pieces to gradually as I build them, and I hope that over time it becomes as useful as I envision it to be. Yes, of course one can just use external libraries someone else has written and get a project up and running, but I think there's a tangible benefit to curating your own library.

In its current state, it's mostly a collection of algorithm and data structure implementations. Sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, binary search trees, graphs, an FFT implementation, etc.
