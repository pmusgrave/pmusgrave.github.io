I think there's an inherent utility in publishing information, even if no one ever sees it. For me, having some hypothetical public readerbase changes the process (and therefore, ultimately the content) of what I write. The way I think about how this blog fits into things is along the lines of the old [Hamming talk](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) about how people worked at Bell Labs: 

> Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, "The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind." I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.

People have used this idea to justify such atrocities as open office floor plans, but the real point of what Hamming was saying is more about the importance of engaging with the broader culture. I think there's a real danger in working in a way that's too isolated, and "isolated" is definitely an accurate description of what I've been doing recently. So, if I'm be truly honest, this blog is for me more than anyone else. But having said that, I'm interested in making content relevant to other people, and I hope this is relevant to you. I guess I'm just interested in publishing the things I'm working on, as a sort of digitally open door policy, because I feel like I've been working with the door closed for too long and starting to veer off into "slightly the wrong things".
